# FilterMapReduceImplementation

I have tried this application to understand how filter map and reduce are internally implemented. For this I have taken problem statement as
follows and according to the below problem statement I tried to implement the filter map and reduce.

1. Accept n no from user and filter out only even no from that n no 
2. After that add 2 in every even number
3. After that perform summation of that modified number

Example :
1. Input       : [1,3,2,4,6,5,4]
2. Filter Data : [2,4,6,4]
3. Map Data    : [4,6,8,6]
4. Reduce Data : 24
