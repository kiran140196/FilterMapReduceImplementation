# FilterMapReduceImplementation

I have tried this application to understand how filter map and reduce are internally implemented.For this I have taken problem statement as
follows and according to the below problem statement I tried to implement the filter map and reduce.

1. Accept n no from user and filter out only even no from that n no 
2. After that add 2 in every even number
3. After that perform summation of that modified number

Input[1,3,2,4,6,5,4]
After filter[2,4,6,4]
After map[4,6,8,6]
After reduce 24
